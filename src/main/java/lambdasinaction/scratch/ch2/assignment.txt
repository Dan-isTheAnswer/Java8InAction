Look at How we can categorize jobs. 
(Lining up vs Categorizing)

The main reason why we categorize jobs rather than statically lining up methods like filterApplesByColor 
is that it facilites cumbersome jobs by seperating logics. 

1) Create two methods,filterApplesByColor and filterApplesByWeight.
2) Create one method, filter, and two methods which are subcategorized into the method filter.
