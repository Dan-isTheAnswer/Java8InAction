Title: Abstraction by Behavior Parameterization 
- From static function to dynamic via Lambda 

1) Create two methods, filterGreenApples(List<Apple> inventory) and filterHeavyApples(List<Apple> inventory).
2) Create two method references using static boolean methods.
3) Create one method, filterApples(List<Apple> inventory, ??), which integrates the above methods via abstraction.
